# 🐧 Daily Drill: OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 0-10)
**Date:** 2026-02-06

**Platform:** [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

**Focus:** Linux Navigation, File Analysis, and Standard Streams

## 1. Executive Summary
Completed the first 11 levels (0-10) of the Bandit wargame. The objective was to recover passwords stored in various non-standard files (hidden, encoded, buried) to advance to the next level. This drill reinforced the ability to manipulate data streams and search the filesystem programmatically.

## 2. The Command Arsenal
| Command | Usage / Concept |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`ls -lah`** | List **all** files (including hidden `.files`) with human-readable sizes. |
| **`file <filename>`** | Determines file type (ASCII text, Data, Executable) regardless of extension. |
| **`strings`** | Extracts printable characters from a binary file. Critical for malware analysis. |
| **`base64 -d`** | Decodes Base64 strings (Common obfuscation technique). |
| **`uniq -u`** | Filters out repeated lines to show only unique entries (Requires `sort` first). |

## 3. Advanced File Hunting (The `find` Command)
The most powerful tool mastered today was `find`.

### Scenario A: Filtering by Content Type
```bash
find . -type f -exec file {} + | grep "text"
```
* **Logic:** Finds all files (`-type f`), runs the `file` command on them (`-exec`), and filters for "text".

* **Use Case:** Locating readable config files amidst a pile of binaries.

### Scenario B: The "Needle in a Haystack"

```bash
find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
```
* **Logic:** Finds a file that is exactly 1033 bytes (`c`) AND is NOT executable (`!`).

* **Use Case:** Identifying a specific payload or log file based on known attributes.

### Scenario C: Searching the Whole System (Permission Handling)
```bash
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
```
* **Key Concept:** `2>/dev/null`

* **Why:** When searching root directories (`/`), you get hundreds of "Permission Denied" errors. Redirecting Stderr (`2>`) to the null device cleans the output so you only see the success hits.

## 4. Handling "Edge Case" Filenames
Linux allows filenames that are difficult to reference. I learned how to handle them:

*   **Files named - (Dash):** The system interprets `-` as "Standard Input." Fix: Use the relative path `./-` or redirect input `cat < -`.
*   **Files with Spaces:** Fix: Use quotes `cat "file name"` or escape characters `cat file\ name`.

## 5. Key Takeaway
The Linux shell treats everything as a file or a stream. Mastering `find` allows me to locate threats based on metadata (who owns it, how big is it) rather than just filename, which is critical for finding malware that disguises itself.
