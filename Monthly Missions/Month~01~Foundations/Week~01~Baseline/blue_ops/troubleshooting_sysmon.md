# 🔧 Troubleshooting Log: The Case of the Silent Sysmon

> A real-world SIEM troubleshooting case study involving Splunk Universal Forwarder, Sysmon, and Windows Event Log permissions.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Date:** February 3, 2026  
**Environment:**  
- Splunk Enterprise (Ubuntu)  
- Splunk Universal Forwarder (Windows 10 Victim VM)  
- Sysmon enabled (Operational channel)

**Incident:**  
Splunk Universal Forwarder successfully connected to the Splunk indexer but failed to ingest **Sysmon Event ID 3 (Network Connections)**.

**Status:** ✅ Resolved

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The Windows 10 victim machine was forwarding:
- Security logs
- System logs
- Application logs

However, **Sysmon telemetry was completely absent**, despite Sysmon being installed and generating events locally.

---

## 🔍 1. Symptoms Observed

**Splunk Search Used:**

```splunk
index=* source="*Sysmon*"
```

## Result

❌ **0 events found**

This confirmed that Sysmon logs were not being indexed at all.

---

## 🕵️ 2. Root Cause Analysis

### Phase 1: Network & Firewall Validation (Layer 3/4)

**Hypothesis:** Network or firewall blockage.

#### Tests Performed

**Ping Test**
- Windows → Ubuntu  
- ✅ Success

**Port Connectivity Check**
```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.122.1 -Port 9997
```

✅ **TcpTestSucceeded : True**

### Socket Verification

```powershell
netstat -an | findstr 9997
```

✅ **ESTABLISHED**

---

## Conclusion

Network path is healthy. Issue exists at the application layer.

---

## Phase 2: Forwarder Configuration Audit

### Hypothesis
Sysmon logs are not configured for ingestion.

### Inspected File
```ini
C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local\inputs.conf
```
### Finding
Default Windows Event Log stanzas existed, but **Sysmon was missing**.

### Fix Attempt

```ini
[WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
disabled = 0
renderXml = 1
```

## Result
❌ Still no Sysmon data.

---

## Phase 3: Time Skew Investigation

### Hypothesis
Events are indexed with incorrect timestamps.

### Findings

- **VM Time:** 02:22 AM (Pacific Time)  
- **Actual Time:** 13:40 PM (UTC+3, Nairobi)

### Impact
Splunk time-based searches excluded events as **historic**.

### Fix

- Synced VM time to **UTC+3**
- Searched using **All Time**

### Result
❌ Still no Sysmon events.

---

## Phase 4: Internal Log Forensics (Breakthrough)

### Hypothesis
Forwarder is failing silently.

### Log Analyzed

```powershell
Select-String "Sysmon" "C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\var\log\splunk\splunkd.log"
```
## 🔍 Critical Finding

```text
ERROR ExecProcessor ... WinEventLogChannel::init: Init failed ... errorCode=5
```
## 🔍 Analysis

- **Windows Error Code 5 = Access Denied**
- The **SplunkForwarder** service account lacked permission to read:

# Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational

---

## 🛠️ 3. Resolution

### Step 1: Privilege Escalation (Legitimate)

- Opened `services.msc`
- Located **SplunkForwarder**
- Changed **Log On As**
  - ❌ Virtual Account
  - ✅ Local System Account

---

### Step 2: Restart & Validation

- Restarted **SplunkForwarder** service
- Verified `splunkd.log`
  - ✅ Error Code 5 disappeared

- Generated Sysmon activity:

```bash
nmap -A 192.168.122.191
```
## Step 3: Final Verification

### Splunk Search

```splunk
index=* source="*Sysmon*" EventCode=3
```
# ✅ Result

Sysmon network telemetry successfully ingested.

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

> “Connected does not mean working.”

- A valid TCP connection only proves transport  
- Permissions decide ingestion  
- When data is missing but the network is healthy:
  - Always check internal application logs  
  - Especially: `splunkd.log`
