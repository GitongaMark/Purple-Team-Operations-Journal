## 👤 About Me
I am a final-year **Mathematics & Computer Science** student at **Maseno University**, aspiring to bridge the gap between offensive security (Red Team) and defensive operations (Blue Team).

This repository documents my intensive 5-month "Purple Team" training roadmap. Unlike traditional study repositories, this journal focuses on **artifacts**: generating real attack traffic and building the exact detection rules required to stop it.

> **Current Status:** 🎓 Final Year Project (*CampusConnect*) & 🛡️ SOC Analyst Training
